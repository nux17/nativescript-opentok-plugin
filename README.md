# Nativescript OpenTok Plugin

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/TeamMaestro/nativescript-opentok, all credit to this repository for the wrapper and actual code.
This plugin is just a dirty but working updated version based on the last OpenTok SDK with a working example.

# Usage

Look at the demo folder for a simple working example.
Replace `API`, `SESSION` and `TOKEN` with actual ones.

# Install

Just run `npm install nativescript-opentok-plugin --save` inside your Nativescript application.
